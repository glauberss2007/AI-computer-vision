## How image is represented in data?

Images are represented in data through a process called digital image encoding. In digital form, images are made up of pixels, which are the smallest unit of information in an image. Each pixel contains color and intensity information.

Combining RGB information allow multiple color generation.

### Image atributs

When reading an image we got the height, width and color channels (RGB). RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue, which are the primary additive colors used in digital imaging. The RGB color model is based on the principle of additive color mixing, where different intensities of red, green, and blue light are combined to create a broad spectrum of colors. In this model, colors are represented by specifying the intensity of each of the three primary colors. RGB is the most common color model used in electronic displays, digital cameras, and various imaging devices. It is widely used in computer graphics, web design, and other digital media applications. Many image file formats, such as JPEG and PNG, store color information using the RGB model.
